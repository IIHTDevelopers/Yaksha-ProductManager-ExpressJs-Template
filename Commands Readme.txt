BackEnd-Commands

You can follow series of command to setup express environment once you are in your project-name folder

* cd into your backend project folder

* npm install -> Will install all dependencies -> takes 10 to 15 min

* npm run start -> To compile and run the project.

* npm run jest -> To run all test cases and see the summary of all passed and failed test cases.

* npm run test -> To run all test cases. It is mandatory to run this command before submission of workspace -> takes 5 to 6 min

* You need to use CTRL+Shift+B - command compulsorily on code IDE, before final submission as well. This will push or save the updated contents in the internal git/repository, and will be used to evaluate the code quality.
